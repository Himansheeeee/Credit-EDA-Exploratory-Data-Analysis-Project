# Credit-Risk-Analysis-EDA-Case-Study

## Business Objective:

- The finance company has to decide on loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Which controls the loss of business to the company and avoids financial loss for the company.
  The loan-providing company finds it hard to give loans to the people due to insufficient or non-existent credit history
  
 **Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:**
 
 1. If the applicant’s is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
 2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, and is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to financial loss for the company.

## Agenda:
- The consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected and identification of such applicants using EDA (Explorartory Data Analysis) is the aim of this case study.
- This case study aims to analyze the patterns that indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan,
  reducing the amount of loan, lending at a higher interest rate, etc.
